# MemoriesApp

MemoriesApp is a console application and my final project for Code Louisville's 2020 C# course.

# Why make the MemoriesApp

One reoccurring piece of advice parents gave my wife and I when we were expecting our first child was to write down memories of their early years. We often heard, "Blink and you will miss it!” I realized that our haphazard way of writing sticky notes and throwing them in the drawer was getting a little hard to keep track of.

With that in mind I wanted to create the MemoriesApp as a simple journal tool to record memories of our two children. My almost 5 year old was not completely impressed and wanted it to do something "silly", hence the “Gibberish” reverse sentence function.
