# MemoriesApp

MemoriesApp is a console application and my final project for Code Louisville's C# course.

One reoccurring piece of advice parents gave my wife and I when we were expecting our first child was to write down memories of their early years. We often heard, "Blink and you will miss it!” 

With that in mind I wanted to create the MemoriesApp as a simple journal tool to record memories, quotes, and the growth of my two kids. My almost 5 year old was not impressed and wanted it to do something silly, hence the “Gibberish” function.  

### Features

Master loop
Switch case
Analyze text and display information about it (Gibberish menu item take user input and reverses or mirrors the sentence)
