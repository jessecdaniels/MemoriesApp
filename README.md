# MemoriesApp

MemoriesApp is a console application and my final project for Code Louisville's 2020 C# course.

# Why make the MemoriesApp

One reoccurring piece of advice parents gave my wife and I when we were expecting our first child was to write down memories of their early years. We often heard, "Blink and you will miss it!” I realized that our haphazard way of writing sticky notes and throwing them in the drawer was getting a little hard to keep track of.

With that in mind I wanted to create the MemoriesApp as a simple journal tool to record memories of our two children. My almost 5 year old was not completely impressed and wanted it to do something "silly", hence the “Gibberish” reverse sentence function.  

## Instructions

Once you run the Memories App, you will be greeted by the title, current date & time, Today's Memories, ONE YEAR AGO, and the main menu options 1-5.

"Today's Memories" prints all memories entered for the current date to the console while "ONE YEAR AGO" prints all memories entered from exactly one year prior. 

To use the Memories App simply enter a menu option 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.

 - [1] Add a memory | This option will prompt you for the date and time (with the time always being optional) of the memory you want to record. Then you will be prompted to enter the memory.
 - [2] Search for memories | This option will prompt you the for date and time that you would like to search memories for.
 - [3] Delete memories | This option with prompt you for the date and time of the memory you would like to delete.
 - [4] Make some gibberish | This option prompts you to enter a sentence you want to reverse, once entered the modified sentence is returned as well as the number of characters in the string and returns that information
 - [5] End | Prompts user to press any key to quit the Memories App...
